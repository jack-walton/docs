# Preface

This is the preface for the blog. I think the blog posts will come from my notebooks. It will be highly curated. Posts may come and go. I really struggled with how to structure a "blog."  I thought about using Substack for a blog. Or to have a separate web build dedicated only to blog posts. It could have been `blog.jackwalton.net` or something. A lot of other developers working with Nextra have done that, have the blog as a link. 

But I'm not really sure that Substack really matches my vibe. I feel like Twitter is enough of a live-blog social media thing. And I like this Nextra site. The framework feels more like  musical instrument than a "content platform." I feel like Andy Stott with an Elektron synth. I want to focus all my web development energy into this one framework.
