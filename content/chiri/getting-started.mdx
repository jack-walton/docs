# Getting Started

1. Edit `src/config.ts` and `src/content/about/about.md` to your liking.

2. Use `pnpm new <title>` to create new posts, or add your posts to `src/content/posts`.

3. You need to set adapter as follows before deploying to Netlify, Vercel, or other platforms, but you can set `linkCard` to `false` in `src/config.ts` to skip this step:

   - **Netlify**: `pnpm add @astrojs/netlify` and add `adapter: netlify()` in `astro.config.ts`.
   - **Vercel**: `pnpm add @astrojs/vercel` and add `adapter: vercel()` in `astro.config.ts`.
   - **Cloudflare Pages**: `pnpm add @astrojs/cloudflare` and add `adapter: cloudflare()` in `astro.config.ts`.
   - **Static (e.g. GitHub Pages)**: `pnpm add @astrojs/static` and add `adapter: static()` in `astro.config.ts`.
   - Refer to [Astro Deployment Guides](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) for more details.
