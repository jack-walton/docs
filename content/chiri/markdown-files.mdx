# Markdown Files

This blog supports all the standard and extended Markdown syntax. It also supports React components in Markdown (MDX). The theme's stylesheet does not visually differentiate heading levels. If needed, you can update the styles in `src/styles/post.css`. 

The blog also supports these HTML elements in Markdown files:

| Element      | HTML     |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Subscript    | `<sub>`  |
| Superscript  | `<sup>`  |
| Abbreviation | `<abbr>` |
| Keyboard     | `<kbd>`  |
| Highlight    | `<mark>` |





## Drafts

Start the filename with `_` to mark it as a draft and hide it from the list. For example, the follow file would not be displayed in the user interface:

```
_markdown-files.md
```
