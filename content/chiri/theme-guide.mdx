# Usage Guide

Once you've installed and configured the blog, you can begin to create content. All blog posts are stored in the `src/content/posts/` folder. The index page is the  `src/content/about/about.md`  file. You can leave it empty if you don't want any content.

## Create a post

In your repository, enter the following command to create a new post:

```bash
pnpm new <title>
```

You can also add your posts to the `src/content/posts` folder using a text editor such as Typora.

## Update Theme

<Callout

type="warning">

After you have configured the blog and updated dependencies, this command can lead to merge conflicts. I don't recommend that you enter this command unless you intend to build the site from scratch.

</Callout>

To update to the latest version of the theme, in your repository, enter this command from the terminal:

```bash
pnpm update-theme
```
