# Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunity Proposal



## I. Project Description

Held at the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art is a twentieth-century, French, illuminated
manuscript (KGC-51) that details the life of Saint Didier by Joseph Royer. Other than the
author’s identity, the origin of this manuscript and the motive for its production remains a
mystery. University of Missouri Curators' Distinguished Professor Virginia Blanton’s
preliminary study of the book has resulted in the hypothesis that Joseph Royer was a
bibliophile that dedicated a large portion of his life to preserving the historical legacy of his
local community by creating this illuminated manuscript in honor of the local patron saint of
Langres, Bishop Didier, in the style of medieval books. Thus, this book was created as an
honorific of Royer’s local community.

Verification of this hypothesis hinges upon the collection of an enormous amount of
data, and Dr. Blanton has invited me to participate in the investigation and detective work
associated with this book. During the plan of work, my goals are to identify the book of
hours used as inspiration for the decorations, transcribe and find the source of the St.
Didier Text, write a biography of Joseph Royer, seek out information on the book, and make
a detailed description of the manuscript. This project will contribute to humanistic
knowledge in many ways.

First, completion of this research will provide insight into artistic book production in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and how authors such as Royer
contributed to the period phenomenon of book arts produced in the medieval style. Second,
this research will provide insight into the continuing value of Saint’s Lives as a literary
genre, an underappreciated and under-researched area. Third, this research will provide a
genealogy of the Royers, bringing to light details of this influential family. Finally, this
research will provide a much-needed study of an archival document, held here in Kansas
City. Professor Blanton and I will collaborate to write an article detailing this research and
seek publication in an academic journal. Moreover, I will compose a blog post to be included
on the CODICES website to highlight our conclusions in an open-access format. Just as
Royer intended his work to elevate the prestige of his town, so too will this research
contribute to the reputation of our university and let the people of Kansas City and its
environs know more about the book collections of the Nelson Atkins library.

## II. Methods

Using high-quality images of KGC 51 provided by the Nelson Atkins, I will provide a
complete transcription of the French text. Preliminary research will be done at the Miller
Nichols Library using digital resources such as the Index for Medieval art. Comparative
study of books of hours, as well as research into nineteenth-century bookmaking will be
done at the Getty Library using their art historical collections, as well as by interviewing
curators. The Getty has materials crucial to this research that I will not be able to find nor
access elsewhere. Specifically, I will investigate the items below:
- The Getty’s extensive study photographs of French paintings and drawings archive
- Laurent de Laura’s
*Elementary instruction in the art of illuminating and missal
painting on vellum: a guide to modern illuminators*
- The Getty’s collections of Books of Hours, such as those by Master of Jacques of
Luxembourg, The Workshop of Gerard Horenbout, Master of the Lübeck Bible,
Georges Trubert, Master of Sir John Fastolf.

While most libraries will not allow undergraduate researchers access to such materials, the
Getty accepts requests to do so. Also, the Getty allows undergraduates stack privileges in
addition to the aforementioned resources. I have already reached out to their library staff to
make arrangements for this to happen. Throughout, Professor Blanton’s research on the
Weckerlin Manuscript will be used as a complementary source text, as will be Lauga’s
article on Royer manuscripts and news articles from Langres. Other crucial source texts
may include the items below:
- The British Library’s digitized
*Hasting Hours*
- Smith’s
*Art, Identity and Devotion in Fourteenth-Century England: Three Women and
their Books of Hours*
- Suire’s
*La sainteté française de la réforme catholique (XVIe–XVIIIe siècles), d'après
les textes hagiographiques et les procès de canonization*
- Winkler’s
*Die flämische Buchmalerei des XV. und XVI. Jahrhunderts: Künstler und
Werke von den Brüdern van Eyck bis zu Simon Bening / Mit 91 Lichtdrucktafeln*
- Scott’s
*The Caxton Master and his Patrons*
- Marcel’s
*La calligraphie et la miniature à Langres à la fin du XVe siècle : histoire et
description du manuscrit 11972-11978 du fonds latin de la Bibliothèque nationale*
- Hindman’s
*Manuscript Illumination in the Modern Age*

Finally, I will need access to at least thirty secondary sources, which are also available at
the Getty.

## IV. Student Background

I have taken courses that have prepared me to do both linguistic and manuscript analysis,
such as History of the English Language, several semesters of Spanish, and Chaucer. In my
free time, I have studied linguistics and the French language specifically, developing a
budding expertise that will suit this project well. My Current GPA is 3.550. However, I am a
returning student, and my first semester back in University, I earned a 4.0 and made the
Dean’s List. This is representative of my current performance. Off campus, I have worked
for many years as a courier and can be counted on to travel expediently and work remotely.
I am also proficient in areas that may aid in the logistical details of the project, including
photography and digital humanities computing.

## V. Importance to Student

I am interested in completing a terminal degree. However, I am not sure whether that
should be an MFA or a PhD. This project will allow me to do a test run of the sort of
empirical research done in my field and thus make a clear decision about the future of my
career. This will be an excellent test of the skills that I am developing at the University.
