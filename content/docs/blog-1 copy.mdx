# About

This page is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and the [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) theme. I would like to give special thanks to [Phuc Bui](https://github.com/phucbm), whose [open source template](https://github.com/phucbm/nextra-docs-starter) helped me a great deal in the development of this site.
