# Introduction

My [portfolio](https://jackwalton.xyz) and my [personal blog](https://jackwalton.net) were both developed using [Astro themes](https://astro.build/themes/). These themes came with sets of developer documentation that help you set up and manage the projects. I have moved those documents here for safe keeping. I have revised them to fit my personal style, tested them for accuracy, and reformatted them to use [Nextra's](https://nextra.site/) components and features. As I work with these themes more, I may add further documentation to handle advanced or latent features.
