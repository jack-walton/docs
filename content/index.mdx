# About

Welcome to the `docs` subdomain of my website. This space serves as my technical writing portfolio. I built this site with Next.js using the Nextra theme. You can learn more about the technical details in this site's [README](https://github.com/jack-walton/docs?tab=readme-ov-file#portfolio).

I wrote the [AXS User Guide](/AXS) as a speculative project. I used that app as a case study to write some user assistance documents to demonstrate my professional abilities. I am not affiliated with AXS or any other related entities.

[Music Information Retrieval in Bandcamp](/bandcamp) is a paper I wrote while I was briefly a graduate student in Library and Information Science at the University of Missouri. I conduct an analysis of the Bandcamp search function and compare it to peer-reviewed UX literature to develop a set of best practices for content managers.

I wrote the [SUROP Grant Proposal](/surop) while I was working as a research assistant at CODICES Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Missouri â€“ Kansas City. The grant was ultimately not funded due to the COVID-19 lockdown, but the proposal received honors for its quality, and the research was funded through alternative means.
