# Introduction

I developed my [personal blog](https://jackwalton.net) using an Astro theme. This theme came with a set of developer documentation that helped me set up and manage the code. I moved those documents here for safe keeping. I've revised and expanded them heavily, tested them for accuracy, made some corrections, and reformatted them to use this site's components and features. 

As I continue to customize the blog, I intend to use this space to keep track of my changes. I may also update this site in the future to document other projects.

This theme uses Markdown to format content. See the [Markdown Guide](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/) for basic syntax. To add interactive components to your Markdown files, you can use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) syntax.
