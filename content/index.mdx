# About

I'm a writer and researcher based out of Kansas City. I've written on subjects ranging from medieval art history to electronic music and technology.

I have a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I've worked as a technical writer for Oracle Corporation and Cerner Corporation. Previously, I served as a research assistant for CODICES Digital Humanities Lab and a substitute library assistant for the Kansas City Public Library.
