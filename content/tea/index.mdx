# Overview of Green Tea

In many ways, green tea is superior to coffee as a morning beverage. It has a much better track record. Green tea has been consumed for tens of thousands of years,[^1] whereas coffee has only been consumed as a beverage for the last few hundred years.[^2] Green tea also offers many health benefits over coffee and can be found just as easily.

## History of Green Tea

Tea is native to China and its use dates back to the Shang dynasty. Originally, it was used as a medicinal beverage. The earliest instruction manual for how to drink green tea, *The Classic of Tea*, dates to around 760 and 762 CE. According to one legend, it was discovered by accident by Emperor Shennong. In another legend, the ancient Zen monk, Bodhidharma, fell asleep during his meditation practice. He cut off his eyelids and threw them away and they transformed into tea plants, a cure for sleepiness.

At certain points in Chinese history, bricks of tea were used to trade and pay taxes instead of money. In the 6th century AD, Buddhist monks introduced green tea to Japan. In the 15th century AD, black tea was invented and spread to Europe, where it became the preferred type of tea. This guide does not touch on this aberration.

## Benefits of Green Tea

Green tea is rich in polyphenols that can reduce inflammation. These compounds can reduce your risk of certain cancers, heart disease, osteoporosis, and other diseases. Additionally, green tea contains an amino acid, L-theanine, which can improve your brain health and reduce anxiety. Green tea also improves your skin tone, helps you lose weight, and generally look younger. The caffeine levels in green tea are lower than coffee, which leads to a more sustainable boost in energy.[^3]

## Where to Find Green Tea

Generally, you can find green tea anywhere that you can find coffee. This guide recommends that you seek out options from your local, organic grocer. Readers who live in remote regions with limited local options can order bulk shipments from reputable wholesalers, such as [Hugo Tea](https://www.hugotea.com/).
